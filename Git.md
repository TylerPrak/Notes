#### Chapter 2

Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.

Version Control System (VCS)

It allows you to revert selected files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more. Using a VCS also generally means that if you screw things up or lose files, you can easily recover. In addition, you get all this for very little overhead.
